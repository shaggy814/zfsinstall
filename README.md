zfsinstall/desktop

This is a simple reference guide that I decided to put all together to assist people installing gentoo on a zfs root. The zfs parts have been taken from ryao's zfs-install, but I will be adding more to the guide in the future, with the hopes of helping people new to gentoo and zfs. It was originally written to help a friend, and I hope it can help someone looking for a streamlined way of getting gentoo up and running.  It is by no means a replacement for the gentoo handbook.
